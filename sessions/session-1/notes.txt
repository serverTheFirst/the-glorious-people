Word has been spreading that the orcs are making a move on the marrows. The leader of the fiercest faction of the orks, big-bad-guy, is not known for his might. He is known for his cunning and his ruthlessness. There is not a law of war this creature follows. His tactics are that of an insurgent.

He is currently amassing forces. He is the leader of 1/9 orc clans. Eldren insiders in the orc clans are reporting that he has already convinced one other clan to join him in an invasion into our lands. Once he reaches and convinces all 9 clans to invade, they will unleash a terror like this world has never seen. 
*plot-twist* he will kill the remaining holdouts when he has 7/9

History: The eldren are the long forgotten inhabitants of this world. They left behind no clue as to who they were or what they accomplished saved for these monumentally large structures made out of an unbreakable glass. Entire towers of this glass, and many other structures speckle the landscape of the seven marrows.

You are speaking with a person that looks nothing like anyone you have seen before in your life who claims to be an eldren, awakened to protect us from a danger so great, none can hide from it.
